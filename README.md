Qorka is an interpreter development platform from SourceNet which allows you to creatively put together your own programming interpreter with ease. This means that I can create my own programming syntax, by defining each fucntion on the Qorka platform. And everytime I write a program with my own programming syntax (programming laguage) in a text editor and run it on Qorka, it will execute the file code according to the functions defined by you.

First open the Qorka code file, "qorka_mac.py" for Mac and "qorka_pc.py" for Windows.
